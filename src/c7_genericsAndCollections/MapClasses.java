/*
Map:
A Map cares about unique identifiers

HashMap:
When you need a Map and you don't care about the order (when you iterate through 
it), then HashMap is the way to go
Allows one null key and multiple null values in a collection

Hashtable:
A Hashtable doesn't let you have anything that's null.
Hashtable is the synchronized counterpart to HashMap

LinkedHashMap:
maintains insertion order
Although it will be somewhat slower than HashMap for adding and removing elements, 
you can expect faster iteration with a LinkedHashMap.

TreeMap:
Is a sorted Map
implements NavigableMap.
