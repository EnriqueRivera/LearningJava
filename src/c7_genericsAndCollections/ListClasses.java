ArrayList:
Choose this over a LinkedList when you need fast iteration but aren't as likely 
to be doing a lot of insertion and deletion.

Vector:
Vector methods are synchronized for thread safety. 
You'll normally want to use ArrayList instead of Vector

LinkedList:
may iterate more slowly than an ArrayList, but it's a good choice when you need 
fast insertion and deletion
now supports the common queue methods: peek(), poll(), and offer().
