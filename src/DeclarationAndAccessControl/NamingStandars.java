    ¡ Classes and interfaces The first letter should be capitalized, and if several
        words are linked together to form the name, the first letter of the inner words
        should be uppercase (a format that's sometimes called "camelCase"). For
        classes, the names should typically be nouns. For example:
            -Dog
            -Account
            -PrintWriter
    
        For interfaces, the names should typically be adjectives like
            -Runnable
            -Serializable
    
    
     ¡ Methods The first letter should be lowercase, and then normal camelCase
        rules should be used. In addition, the names should typically be verb-noun
        pairs. For example:
            -getBalance
            -doCalculation
            -setCustomerName
    
    ¡ Variables Like methods, the camelCase format should be used, starting with
        a lowercase letter. Sun recommends short, meaningful names, which sounds
        good to us. Some examples:
            -buttonWidth
            -accountBalance
            -myString
    
    ¡ Constants Java constants are created by marking variables static and
        final. They should be named using uppercase letters with underscore
        characters as separators:
            -MIN_HEIGHT
