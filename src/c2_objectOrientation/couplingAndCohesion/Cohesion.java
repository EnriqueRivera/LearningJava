/*
    The term cohesion is used to indicate the degree
    to which a class has a single, well-focused purpose. Keep in mind that cohesion is a
    subjective concept. The more focused a class is, the higher its cohesivenessâ€”a good
    thing. The key benefit of high cohesion is that such classes are typically much easier
    to maintain (and less frequently changed) than classes with low cohesion. Another
    benefit of high cohesion is that classes with a well-focused purpose tend to be more
    reusable than other classes.
