/*
    Coupling is the degree
    to which one class knows about another class. If the only knowledge that class A
    has about class B, is what class B has exposed through its interface, then class A and
    class B are said to be loosely coupled…that's a good thing. If, on the other hand,
    class A relies on parts of class B that are not part of class B's interface, then the
    coupling between the classes is tighter…not a good thing. In other words, if A knows
    more than it should about the way in which B was implemented, then A and B are
    tightly coupled.
